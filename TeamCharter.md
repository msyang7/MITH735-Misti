## Shared values
### Interdisciplinary
We are an interdisciplinary group of scholars. Through this collaboration, we value the benefits of learning and utilizing the teachings of the disciplines and methods that may suit our research questions. We encourage others to bring disciplinary expertise when relevant. We also acknowledge the limitations of being fully considered interdisciplinary within a small group.

### Fighting imposter syndrome
As a collaborative group we value the well being of our groups members. We aim to support each other through times of self doubt. We will fight imposter syndrome by encouraging each other to use our skill sets to our individual and our group's advantage. We will also help each other eliminate any fear of asking questions or asking for help. We acknowledge we are all new to this kind of work and strive to support each other and help give each other confidence.

## Sustainability considerations
We value that email is a sustainable form of a communication and will suffice for the current purposes of this charter.

As all of our individual projects will have different timelines and trajectories, our primary focus is for the remainder of the spring semester. Yet, we are open to sustainability considerations past the end of this semester as we continue.

## Statement on shared credit
Note of written acknowledgement in publication if this group or conversations held within this group influenced a particular idea or thought.

## Conflict management
We value the ease of communication, and we generally define conflict as anything that will pose a difficulty to communication. In the event of irreconcilable conflict, we value the advice of a third-party mediator. The qualifications for a third-party mediator are that they are neutral and open to listening. They can either offer guidance over a group email thread or do an in-person facilitation.
