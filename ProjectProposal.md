*Spark* A Study in the History of Ethics and Engineering
===
Project Proposal by Misti Yang
---

The central research question for my project is: **What does *Spark* magazine reveal about engineers’ engagement with ethical and political issues during the 1970s?** In addition to answering this question, my goal is to vivify the history of engineering ethics in order to help demonstrate that objectivity and efficiency are not the historic or natural values of engineers.
Issues of *Spark* will be my primary object of study, my “source” (Posner). The magazine was first published by the Committee for Social Responsibility in Engineering (CSRE) in March 1971, and its last issue ran in 1975. The founders of CSRE and Spark were reacting in part against the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) professional association. Contributors to both the organization and magazine felt that the IEEE was not adequately addressing important ethical and political  issues of the time.

Questions related to my primary research question include:
---
* What issues did the magazine cover?
* What people and organizations are mentioned, either as contributors, organizers, exemplars, or “villains”?
* Where were events and organizations located geographically?
* How are issues depicted, in other words, who is blamed, and how are solutions framed?

Given my research questions, I would like to use distant reading to extract data that will enable me to create visualizations, specifically word clouds, maps, and/or networks. Word clouds will help highlight what issues and themes *Spark* addressed most frequently. Maps will help visualize the national scope of engineers and organizations working on related issues. Network visualizations will show how people and organizations are connected but may be the hardest to create. I would have to determine what constitutes a connection, a process that Franco Moretti (2011) describes as being potentially fruitful, but somewhat arbitrary.

Of the visualizations, I think I am most interested in mapping for two reasons. First, the map will create a structure that I could potentially use to organize additional data that I might extract in the future. For example, an icon on a map might represent the *Spark* headquarters, and clicking on that might lead to additional resources, such as the editorial team and a list of articles they each wrote. I am also interested in mapping because I think it will demonstrate that even before the internet, groups across the country were connected through publications such as *Spark*. It will help me to realize my goal of vivifying the history of engineering ethics. Spatializing the efforts of engineers will literally and metaphorically ground their work in a visual manner that I think will be more engaging than a network visualization.    

Models for my project include [The Cybernetics Thought Collective: A History of Science and Technology Portal Project](https://archives.library.illinois.edu/thought-collective/ "Cybernetics home") and The Swag Diplomacy: Black Travel Memoirs (no longer available online). The Cybernetics Thought Collective has made its machine-learning software/process available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cybernetics-thought-collective), but I lack the expertise to know if it might be helpful for my project. It appears that the software that Swag Diplomacy used for mapping, Viewshare, no longer exists, but there is a Viewshare repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/viewshare). I also found a list of GIS apps and sites that might be useful [here](https://guides.nyu.edu/dighum/tools).

In terms of relevant literature, the text of *Spark* itself should be generative enough to answer my research questions. However, I do have a working bibliography (see below) of sources for understanding both the context of the time and what has been previously written about the history of ethics and engineering. Matthew Wisnioski’s *Engineers for Change: Competing Visions of Technology in 1960s America* is where I first learned about the magazine, so detailing his analysis of *Spark* will be important to the literature review. I am also trying to conduct an oral history with Stephen Unger, one of the early contributors to *Spark*, for another seminar I am taking this semester.

Thinking about scheduling, I would like to attempt a distant reading by April 5th. In order to do this, I need to scan portions of *Spark* this week. Regardless of whether distant reading proves possible, I will finalize a GIS application/software to use by April 5th so that I can determine how I would need to process the information in *Spark* and think about the possible presentation of that information. If distant reading is not possible, I think a reasonable goal is to “map” one issue of *Spark* for a working project prototype.
