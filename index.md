*Spark* A Study in the History of Ethics and Engineering
=====
*Spark* was a magazine first published by the Committee for Social Responsibility in Engineering (CSRE) in March 1971, and its last issue ran in 1975. The founders of CSRE and Spark were reacting in part against the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) professional association. Contributors to both the organization and magazine felt that the IEEE was not adequately addressing important ethical and political issues of the time. This project aims to vivify the history of engineering ethics in order to help demonstrate that objectivity and efficiency are not the historic or natural values of engineers.
