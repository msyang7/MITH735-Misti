SPARK would like to encourage communication between otherwise isolated individuals and groups and indeed to encourage the formation of groups throughout the country. If anything is happening out your way, let us know, your experience may be of use to others. SPARK is particularly interested in news of layoffs, job actions, military or other interesting contracts your company is handling, suppression or misuse of scientific and technical information, and discontent among technical workers.

Any individual, groupuscule, group, tendency or faction is invited to send us news items, full articles (news or analysis). These are three categories of solicited material;

1) News Items
Send us the raw information and tell us how to get in touch with you. We do the writing and check with your for clarification if necessary.

2) Essays
Submit typewritten double spaced manuscripts on 8 ½ by 11 paper.

3) Columns
For a nominal fee (payable in subscriptions or otherwise) we will print your articles under your logo. Send us 8 ½ by 11 paste-ups. Nothing will be changed but articles are not protected against rebuttal, contradiction or contentious objection.

Columns and articles reflect the opinions of the originating individuals or groups who are not necessarily in mutual philosophical accord.  

Let the sparks fly!!
